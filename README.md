    - I think that the progression of AI exibited in ChatGPT is increadibly interesting. Though the growth of AI is a littel scary because it has the ability to take many jobs inclubing programming jobs I think that it is more of a tool than a replacement. The information that ChatGPT produces at the moment is not always acurate and still needs some human assitance to correct but is getting increasingly better. I also find this wevsite interesting because of all the of background algortihms running to make the AI work properly. I took the NYU AI course last seemester and knowing a fraction of what it takes to run ChatGPT gives me imense respect for the AI and the programers behind it.

I agree that as of now it is more of a tool than a replacement, which is rather
cool since you can use it to complete tasks that you do not necessarily know how
to do, like editing a video, or creating an itinerary. With advancements made so
far, i am really looking forward to what AI would be capable of in the next 10
years.
